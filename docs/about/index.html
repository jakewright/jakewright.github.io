I would use <em>Microsoft FrontPage</em> to build websites for made-up companies. I spent the next few years learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>In 2006, I learnt how to program in C# from a bright orange book that I bought in <em>PC World</em>. It guided me through building a web browser (which was really just an instance of <em>Internet Explorer</em> with some custom buttons around the edge), among some other small programs. It was simple, and it was stupid, but it was exciting.</p><p><img src=/img/build-a-program-now.jpg alt=/img/build-a-program-now.jpg title=/img/build-a-program-now.jpg></p><p>My GCSE results were 5 A*s and 3 As. At this point, I knew I wanted to study Computer Science at university, and thanks to an outreach event that allowed me to visit when I was 16, I really wanted that university to be Cambridge. To this end, I studied <em>Maths</em>, <em>Further Maths</em>, <em>Physics</em> and <em>Computing</em> at A Level, achieving A*A*A*A*.</p><p>The hard work paid off when I was invited for an interview at Cambridge and subsequently given an offer to study Computer Science at Queens' College.</p><p>I made weekly vlogs throughout my time as a student and graduated in 2015 with a II.i. The course was very theoretical and has given me invaluable knowledge of the principles of Computer Science as well as the practical skills needed to solve problems. I am now living in London and working as a software engineer.</p></div></article></main><footer><ul><li><a href=https://youtube.com/jaketvee rel=me>YouTube</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/jakewrightuk rel=me>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://www.instagram.com/jakewrightuk/ rel=me>Instagram</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jakewright rel=me>GitHub</a></li></ul><p>&copy; 2021 Jake Wright</footer></body></html>
